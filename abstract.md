Perl 6 was released for Christmas. Now its time to get the show on the road.
This miniconf will focus on Perl and how it is shaping the future of Open Source software.
We'll have talks from all angles of perl 6 and how we got there from perl 5.
After lunch we'll have a mini workshop on setting up a perl 6 development environment and getting your first program out the door.
