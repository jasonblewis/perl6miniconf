Christmas 2015 brought a gift the world had anticipated for years: [Perl 6](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/christmas-is-here/).

Despite the name, Perl 6 isn't the next version of the Perl programming language. Perl 5 has its own [vibrant development and release cycle](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlhist.html).

No, Perl 6 is a sister language to the tried and true Perl 5 and is an entirely new programming language. It's design is based not only on decades of observing and learning from Perl 5, but also on the trends and needs of software development for decades to come.

This miniconf will introduce Perl 6 to the world. It will feature:

* An introduction to Perl 6
* Examples of Perl 6 use in the real world
* Discussions of the future of Perl 6 and how people can help
* A hands-on workshop where attendees will set up a Perl 6 development environment and write their first lines of Perl 6 code!
